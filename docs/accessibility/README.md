This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Piano Fitness accessibility system.

## Documents

### [Architecture Guide](architecture.md)

Comprehensive guide to the modular accessibility architecture, including:

- System overview and goals
- Component descriptions (services, widgets, mixins, configuration)
- Usage patterns and examples
- Migration guidance for future development
- Best practices and contributing guidelines

### [P0 Implementation Report](p0-implementation-report.md)

Detailed report on the Critical P0 accessibility improvements implementation:

- Executive summary of completed work
- Technical implementation details
- Testing and validation results
- Impact assessment and success metrics
- Future roadmap and next steps

## Quick Start

For developers working with accessibility features:

1. **Read the Architecture Guide** to understand the system design and components
2. **Import the accessibility library** in your code:

   ```dart
   import "package:piano_fitness/shared/accessibility/accessibility.dart";
   ```

3. **Use accessible widgets** instead of regular components:

   ```dart
   AccessiblePiano(
     child: InteractivePiano(...),
     mode: PianoMode.practice,
     highlightedNotes: notes,
   )
   ```

4. **Apply accessibility mixins** to your StatefulWidgets for common patterns
5. **Reference centralized labels** through `AccessibilityLabels` class

## Key Implementation Files

The accessibility system is organized in `lib/shared/accessibility/`:

- **Configuration**: `config/accessibility_labels.dart`
- **Services**: `services/*.dart` (piano, MIDI, announcements)
- **Widgets**: `widgets/accessible_widgets.dart`
- **Mixins**: `mixins/accessibility_mixins.dart`
- **Main Export**: `accessibility.dart`

## Testing

Accessibility features should be tested with:

- **Unit tests** for individual services and components
- **Widget tests** with semantic finders
- **Manual testing** with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
- **Integration tests** for complete user workflows

## Contributing

When adding accessibility features:

1. Update centralized labels in `accessibility_labels.dart`
2. Create focused services for new feature areas
3. Build reusable widgets for common UI patterns
4. Extract patterns into mixins for repeated logic
5. Update the main export file with new components
6. Document usage patterns and examples
