### ✅ 3. MIDI Device Status Announcements

**Problem**: MIDI connection status not communicated to screen readers
**Solution**: Live region announcements and comprehensive MIDI accessibility

**Files Modified/Created**:

- `lib/shared/accessibility/services/midi_accessibility_service.dart` (NEW)
- `lib/shared/accessibility/mixins/accessibility_mixins.dart` (NEW)
- `lib/features/device_controller/device_controller_page.dart`
- `lib/features/midi_settings/midi_settings_page.dart`

**Implementation Details**:

- Created `MidiAccessibilityService` for MIDI-specific features
- Developed `MidiAccessibilityMixin` for common MIDI semantic patterns
- Live announcements for device connection/disconnection
- Enhanced MIDI controls with proper semantic markup

### Architecture Benefits

**Modularity**: Separated accessibility concerns into focused, reusable components

- Each service handles a specific accessibility domain
- Mixins provide reusable patterns across widgets
- Widgets offer pre-built accessible components

**Consistency**: Centralized configuration ensures uniform terminology

- `AccessibilityLabels` provides single source of truth
- Consistent semantic markup across the application
- Standardized announcement patterns

**Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

- Services can be updated independently
- Configuration changes propagate automatically
- Isolated components simplify debugging

**Scalability**: Foundation supports future enhancements

- New accessibility features can be added without affecting existing code
- Plugin architecture for accessibility services
- Extensible pattern for additional accessibility needs

**Testability**: Isolated components enable comprehensive testing

- Services can be unit tested independently
- Widget components can be tested with semantic finders
- Mixins can be tested in isolation

### Key Components
