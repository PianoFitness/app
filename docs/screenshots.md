## Getting Screenshots for App Store Connect

To create professional App Store screenshots that meet Apple's requirements, follow these steps to launch the app on the correct simulator devices:

### iPad Screenshots (Required: 13-inch display)

1. **List available iPad simulators**:
   ```bash
   xcrun simctl list devices available | grep -i "ipad.*13"
   ```

2. **Boot the iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) simulator**:
   ```bash
   # Find the device ID from the list above, then boot it
   xcrun simctl boot "DEVICE-ID-HERE"
   ```

3. **Open the simulator**:
   ```bash
   # Replace DEVICE-ID-HERE with the actual device ID
   open -a Simulator --args -CurrentDeviceUDID DEVICE-ID-HERE
   ```

4. **Launch the app on iPad 13-inch**:
   ```bash
   # Verify the device is available
   flutter devices
   
   # Launch the app (replace DEVICE-ID-HERE with actual ID)
   flutter run -d "DEVICE-ID-HERE"
   ```

5. **Take screenshots**:
   - Use **Cmd+S** in the Simulator to save screenshots
   - Or use: `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot screenshot-ipad.png`

### iPhone Screenshots (Required: 6.9-inch display)

1. **List available iPhone simulators**:
   ```bash
   xcrun simctl list devices available | grep -i "iphone.*pro max"
   ```

2. **Boot iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator** (6.9-inch display):
   ```bash
   # Find the iPhone 16 Pro Max device ID, then boot it
   xcrun simctl boot "IPHONE-DEVICE-ID-HERE"
   ```

3. **Launch the app on iPhone**:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d "IPHONE-DEVICE-ID-HERE"
   ```

4. **Take screenshots**:
   - Use **Cmd+S** in the Simulator
   - Screenshots will be saved to Desktop by default

### Screenshot Requirements for App Store Connect

- **iPad**: Must use 13-inch display (iPad Pro 13-inch M4 or iPad Air 13-inch M3)
- **iPhone**: Must use 6.9-inch display (iPhone 16 Pro Max or iPhone 15 Pro Max)
- **Format**: PNG format (automatically generated by Simulator)
- **Orientation**: Both portrait and landscape supported
- **Count**: 3-10 screenshots per device category

### Tips for Quality Screenshots

1. **Hide debug elements**:
   - Debug banner is already hidden via `debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false`
   - Ensure no development overlays are visible

2. **Optimal content**:
   - Show key features like piano keyboard, exercises, and progress tracking
   - Demonstrate both beginner and advanced functionality
   - Include various app states (playing, analyzing, reviewing progress)

3. **Clean presentation**:
   - Use realistic data rather than placeholder content
   - Ensure good lighting/contrast in the simulator
   - Take screenshots of the most visually appealing screens

4. **Multiple orientations**:
   - Portrait: Best for navigation and list views
   - Landscape: Ideal for piano keyboard interface
