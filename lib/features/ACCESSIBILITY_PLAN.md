# Piano Fitness Accessibility Improvement Plan

This document outlines accessibility improvements needed across all features in the Piano Fitness app, organized by priority and feature area.

## Overview

After conducting a comprehensive audit of all features (device_controller, midi_settings, notifications, play, practice, reference, repertoire), several accessibility improvements have been identified. These improvements focus on semantic annotations, screen reader support, keyboard navigation, responsive design, and inclusive interaction patterns.

## Priority Levels

- **Critical (P0)**: Essential accessibility barriers that prevent users with disabilities from using core functionality
- **High (P1)**: Important improvements that significantly enhance accessibility
- **Medium (P2)**: Good-to-have improvements that provide better UX for accessibility users
- **Low (P3)**: Nice-to-have enhancements for comprehensive accessibility support

- Add patterns or icons alongside color-coded elements
- Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios (check against WCAG guidelines)
- Implement high contrast mode support
- Add shape/texture alternatives to color coding

### 10. Error Handling and Feedback

**Files**: `midi_settings_page.dart:157-184`, error handling throughout app  
**Issue**: Error messages need better accessibility support  
**Required Actions**:

- Add `Semantics` announcements for error states
- Implement screen reader friendly error descriptions
- Add semantic associations between form fields and error messages
- Provide clear recovery instructions

### 11. Loading States and Progress Indicators

## Notes

- This plan should be reviewed and updated as new features are added
- Regular accessibility audits should be conducted as part of the development process
- Consider engaging with accessibility consultants for complex musical interface challenges
- Piano-specific accessibility patterns may require innovative solutions due to the unique nature of musical interfaces

## Additional Theme and Color Accessibility Issues

### Hard-coded Color Usage Audit Results

The following files contain hard-coded color usage that should be replaced with theme-based colors:

- **device_controller_page.dart**: Hard-coded `Colors.green.shade50`, `Colors.black`, `Colors.white`
- **midi_settings_page.dart**: Hard-coded `Colors.blue`, `Colors.grey`
- **play_page.dart**: Hard-coded `Colors.deepPurple.shade50`
- **practice_hub_page.dart**: Hard-coded `Colors.deepPurple`, `Colors.blue`, `Colors.green`, etc.
- **reference_page.dart**: Hard-coded `Colors.blue.shade50`, `Colors.green.shade50`
- **repertoire_page.dart**: Uses theme colors appropriately (good example)

### Dark Mode Support Gap

While the app supports dark mode through system detection, users cannot manually toggle between light and dark themes within the app settings. This is an accessibility issue for users who:

- Need high contrast mode at specific times
- Have light sensitivity that changes throughout the day
- Use accessibility tools that work better with specific theme modes
- Want consistent theming across apps regardless of system settings

### Recommended Actions

1. **Theme Color Migration**: Replace all hard-coded colors with `colorScheme` equivalents
2. **Dark Mode Settings**: Add user-accessible dark mode toggle in app settings
3. **High Contrast Mode**: Implement high contrast theme variant
4. **Color Contrast Validation**: Audit all color combinations against WCAG AA standards
