## Architecture Overview

Piano Fitness is a Flutter app focused on piano practice with MIDI integration. The app follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture** with feature-based organization and a shared code layer for common functionality.

### Core Architecture Pattern

**MVVM with Clean Architecture**: The app uses a modern feature-based MVVM architecture where each major function is organized into self-contained modules:

- **PlayPage** (`lib/features/play/`) - Main interface focused on piano interaction
- **PracticePage** (`lib/features/practice/`) - Guided practice exercises with real-time feedback
- **MidiSettingsPage** (`lib/features/midi_settings/`) - MIDI device configuration and connection management
- **DeviceControllerPage** (`lib/features/device_controller/`) - Individual MIDI device testing and control

Each feature follows the MVVM pattern:
- **View** (Page): Pure UI layer, handles user interactions and displays data
- **ViewModel**: Business logic layer, manages state and coordinates between View and shared services
- **Model**: Data structures and business rules (in shared layer)

### Navigation Flow
1. App opens to PlayPage (piano-focused interface)  
2. Settings gear icon → MidiSettingsPage (MIDI configuration)
3. Connected device → DeviceControllerPage (device-specific controls)
4. Practice mode buttons → PracticePage (guided exercises)

### Key Dependencies
- **flutter_midi_command** (^0.5.1) - MIDI device communication and Bluetooth handling
- **piano** (^1.0.4) - Interactive piano keyboard UI component
- **cupertino_icons** (^1.0.8) - iOS-style icons

### MIDI Integration Patterns

The app handles complex MIDI workflows across multiple pages:

**Device Discovery & Connection** (MidiSettingsPage):
- Bluetooth permission handling with user dialogs
- Device scanning with timeout and error handling  
- Connection state management with retry mechanisms
- Comprehensive error states (simulator limitations, Bluetooth off, permissions)

**Real-time MIDI Processing** (All pages with MIDI):
- StreamSubscription pattern for MIDI data
- Message filtering (ignores beat clock 0xF8, active sense 0xFE)
- Note/CC/Program/Pitch bend message parsing
- Proper resource disposal in dispose() methods

**Virtual MIDI Output**:
- NoteOnMessage/NoteOffMessage with fallback to raw MIDI bytes
- Channel selection (0-15, displayed as 1-16)
- Velocity and timing control

### State Management Strategy

Uses **MVVM with ChangeNotifier and Provider pattern**:
- **ViewModels**: Extend ChangeNotifier for business logic and state management
- **Provider**: Dependency injection for ViewModels and shared services
- **MidiState**: Global shared state for real-time MIDI data using ChangeNotifier
- **Local UI State**: StatefulWidget for view-specific UI state
- **StreamSubscriptions**: Real-time MIDI events handled in ViewModels
- **Resource Management**: Proper subscription cleanup in ViewModel dispose() methods

### Error Handling Patterns

**MIDI Connection Errors**:
- Graceful fallback when Bluetooth unavailable
- User-friendly error messages with troubleshooting tips  
- Retry mechanisms with reset functionality
- Platform-specific guidance (simulator vs device)

**Development Considerations**:
- Debug logging with `if (kDebugMode)` guards
- Exception handling around MIDI operations
- Timeout handling for Bluetooth operations

### Code Organization

Piano Fitness follows a **feature-based MVVM architecture** with a shared layer for common functionality. This organization provides clear separation of concerns, excellent testability, and maintainable code structure.

#### **Architecture Principles for New Code**

**MVVM Pattern Compliance**:
1. **View (Page)**: Keep pages focused purely on UI and user interaction
   - Handle user inputs and delegate to ViewModel
   - Use AnimatedBuilder/Consumer to react to ViewModel changes
   - No business logic in pages - only UI state management
   - Move complex calculations to ViewModel or shared utilities

2. **ViewModel**: Business logic layer extending ChangeNotifier
   - Handle all feature-specific business logic
   - Coordinate between View and shared services/models
   - Manage feature-specific state and notify View of changes
   - Process MIDI data, manage practice sessions, device operations
   - Proper resource cleanup in dispose() method

3. **Shared Layer**: Common functionality across features
   - **Models**: Data structures and global state (MidiState, PracticeSession)
   - **Services**: External integrations and protocol handling (MIDI)
   - **Utils**: Pure functions and music theory (no state)
   - **Widgets**: Reusable UI components

**Development Guidelines**:
4. **Music Theory**: Always extend existing shared/utils/ classes
   - Don't duplicate note conversion logic
   - Use existing scale/chord/arpeggio definitions  
   - Add new music theory to shared utilities, not features

5. **MIDI Handling**: Centralize through shared/services/midi_service.dart
   - Don't parse MIDI messages directly in ViewModels
   - Use existing MidiEvent structures
   - Add new message types to the shared service layer

6. **State Management**: Use MVVM with Provider pattern
   - **Global State**: shared/models/midi_state.dart (ChangeNotifier)
   - **Feature State**: ViewModel extends ChangeNotifier
   - **UI State**: StatefulWidget for view-specific UI state only
   - **Business State**: Models like PracticeSession in shared layer

7. **Testing**: Mirror lib/ structure in test/
   - Unit tests for shared/utils/, shared/services/, and ViewModels  
   - Widget tests for feature pages and shared/widgets/
   - Integration tests for cross-feature functionality

**Import Conventions**:
1. Dart core libraries first (`dart:async`, `dart:math`)
2. Flutter framework libraries (`package:flutter/material.dart`)
3. Third-party packages (`package:piano/piano.dart`)
4. Local imports in order:
   - Feature imports: `package:piano_fitness/features/...`
   - Shared imports: `package:piano_fitness/shared/...`

**Import Examples**:
```dart
// ViewModel importing shared utilities
import "package:piano_fitness/shared/models/midi_state.dart";
import "package:piano_fitness/shared/services/midi_service.dart";
import "package:piano_fitness/shared/utils/note_utils.dart";

// Page importing its ViewModel and shared widgets
import "package:piano_fitness/features/practice/practice_page_view_model.dart";
import "package:piano_fitness/shared/widgets/practice_settings_panel.dart";
```

### Testing Strategy

The codebase follows Flutter testing patterns with **mandatory test coverage requirements**:

#### **Test Coverage Requirements**
- **New Features**: Must have ≥80% test coverage for all new code
- **Bug Fixes**: Must include regression tests to prevent re-occurrence  
- **Refactoring**: Must maintain or improve existing test coverage
- **MIDI Functionality**: Requires comprehensive unit tests due to complexity

#### **Testing Workflow** (MANDATORY)
1. **Before Development**: Check current coverage baseline
   ```bash
   flutter test --coverage
   ```

2. **During Development**: Write tests alongside code
   - Unit tests for business logic (models, utilities)
   - Widget tests for UI components  
   - Integration tests for MIDI workflows

3. **After Development**: Verify coverage meets requirements
   ```bash
   flutter test --coverage && genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
   open coverage/html/index.html  # Review coverage report
   ```

4. **Coverage Verification**: Ensure all critical paths are tested
   - Core MIDI operations (note on/off, device connection)
   - State management changes (MidiState, UI updates)
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - User interaction flows

#### **Test Organization**
Tests mirror the lib/ structure exactly for easy navigation and maintenance:

### MIDI Platform Considerations

**Simulator Limitations**: MIDI/Bluetooth functionality requires physical devices
**Permission Handling**: Proactive Bluetooth permission requests with explanatory dialogs
**Cross-platform**: Supports iOS, Android, desktop platforms with flutter_midi_command

### Piano Keyboard Layout Implementation

The app features optimized 49-key piano layouts across both PlayPage and PracticePage with consistent 20% screen height allocation for better key proportions on iPad.

#### **Current Layout Specifications**

**Screen Height Distribution**:
- Content Area: 80% (flex: 4) - Settings, educational content, practice controls
- Piano Keyboard: 20% (flex: 1) - Interactive 49-key piano with proper aspect ratio

**Key Width Calculation**:
```dart
// Dynamic width based on screen size
final screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
final availableWidth = screenWidth - 32; // Account for padding
final dynamicKeyWidth = availableWidth / 29; // 28 white keys + buffer
keyWidth: dynamicKeyWidth.clamp(20.0, 60.0) // Reasonable limits
```

**49-Key Range Implementation**:

**PlayPage** - Fixed Range (MVVM):
- **Range**: C2 to C6 (exactly 49 keys spanning 4 octaves)
- **Purpose**: Consistent layout for general piano interaction
- **Implementation**: 
  - **ViewModel**: `lib/features/play/play_page_view_model.dart` - `getFixed49KeyRange()`
  - **View**: `lib/features/play/play_page.dart` - Uses ViewModel for range calculation

**PracticePage** - Dynamic Centering (MVVM):
- **Range**: Calculated to center around current exercise
- **Algorithm**: 
  1. Find min/max notes in exercise sequence
  2. Calculate center point of exercise range
  3. Create 49-key range centered on exercise
  4. Shift range if needed to include all exercise notes
  5. Clamp to reasonable piano range (A0 to C8)
- **Purpose**: Eliminates horizontal scrolling for all practice exercises
- **Implementation**:
  - **ViewModel**: `lib/features/practice/practice_page_view_model.dart` - `calculatePracticeRange()`
  - **View**: `lib/features/practice/practice_page.dart` - Uses ViewModel for dynamic range
  - **Shared Utility**: `lib/shared/utils/piano_range_utils.dart` - Range calculation logic

#### **Piano Range Calculation Logic**

**Exercise-Centered Algorithm** (PracticePage):
```dart
// Find exercise range
final minNote = exerciseNotes.reduce((a, b) => a < b ? a : b);
final maxNote = exerciseNotes.reduce((a, b) => a > b ? a : b);
final centerNote = (minNote + maxNote) ~/ 2;

// Create 49-key range (24 semitones on each side)
const rangeHalfWidth = 24;
var startNote = centerNote - rangeHalfWidth;
var endNote = centerNote + rangeHalfWidth;

// Ensure all exercise notes are visible
if (minNote < startNote) {
  final shift = startNote - minNote;
  startNote -= shift;
  endNote -= shift;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- No horizontal scrolling required for any practice exercise
- Optimal key proportions with 20% screen height
- Responsive design adapts to all screen sizes
- Consistent user experience across pages

#### **Integration with Music Theory**

The piano layouts integrate seamlessly with music theory utilities:

- **Scales**: Typically span 1-2 octaves starting from octave 4 (middle C)
- **Chords**: Use octave 4 with smart progression logic to avoid excessive range
- **Arpeggios**: Support 1-2 octave patterns based on user selection

All practice exercises are designed to fit within the 49-key constraint while maintaining musical integrity and proper voice leading.

### Development Notes

- MIDI operations can block UI - handle asynchronously
- Resource cleanup critical for MIDI streams and connections
- Use const constructors for performance optimization
- Debug mode logging essential for MIDI troubleshooting
- Piano layout changes should maintain 49-key constraint for consistency
- Exercise sequences should be validated to fit within 4-octave ranges
